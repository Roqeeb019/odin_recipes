<P>
   <strong> Fried yam is a deep-fried yam recipe that can be eaten with a wide range of Nigerian stews and sauces. It is fried in such a way that the outside of the chips is crunchy while the inside is moist.</strong></P>
<p>   Ingridients

   <p>Frying Directions
       <ol>
           <li>Peel and cut the yam tuber into 1 inch cylindrical discs. Make several cuts across the discs to get large chips. Wash the yam chips and place in a bowl. </li>
           <li>Add a little salt and toss the contents to distribute the salt</li>
           <li>If you are using a deep fryer, pour enough vegetable oil into the fryer as per the instructions manual and preheat the oil to 170Â°C. You can also use a pot to fry the yam chips. It is preferable to use a pot rather than a frying pan for this fried yam recipe because pots provide more depth for the frying process.</li>
           <li>When the oil is heated, add a few yam chips, leaving enough room for flipping the chips.</li>
           <li>Stir the chips till they have turned golden.</li>
           <li>Remove the chips and place in paper towels to absorb the oil.</li>
           <li>Fry the rest of the chips following steps 4 through 6.</li></ol> </p>
